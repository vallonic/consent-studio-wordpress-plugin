# Consent Studio for WordPress
## Important note
The current purpose of this plugin is **only** to add the `banner.js` script to your website's `<head></head>`. Nothing more. We will build a complete integration in the first quarter of 2025. If you need more functionality, i.e. the ability to enable or disable Google Consent Mode v2 and modify its (regional) `default` consent signals, please use [our GTM Template](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/owners/vallonic/templates/consent-studio-gtm-template).
